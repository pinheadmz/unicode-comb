### Unsafe characters

```
\u202a-\u202e
\u2066-\u2069
\u3164
```

### Usage

Compile and run with root directory as argument:

(example)
```
gcc unicode-comb.c && ./a.out /Users/matthewzipkin/Desktop/work/hsd
```

### Output

Lots and lots of files, we even check everything in `node_modules`, finally:

```
...
dir: /Users/matthewzipkin/Desktop/work/hsd/lib/dns
 scanning: /Users/matthewzipkin/Desktop/work/hsd/lib/dns/key.js
 scanning: /Users/matthewzipkin/Desktop/work/hsd/lib/dns/resource.js
 scanning: /Users/matthewzipkin/Desktop/work/hsd/lib/dns/server.js
 scanning: /Users/matthewzipkin/Desktop/work/hsd/lib/dns/common.js
 scanning: /Users/matthewzipkin/Desktop/work/hsd/lib/dns/nsec.js
 scanning: /Users/matthewzipkin/Desktop/work/hsd/lib/pkg.js
 scanning: /Users/matthewzipkin/Desktop/work/hsd/.eslintrc.json
 scanning: /Users/matthewzipkin/Desktop/work/hsd/SECURITY.md
OK: Scanned 1336 files in 277 directories in 35.000000 seconds
```

### You gotta problem if...

Copy one of the illegal characters for example from here:

https://unicode-explorer.com/c/202E

Or you can try to copy it from this line of code:

```
// sneaky char between these two colons :â€®:
```

... and paste it anywhere in your codebase. Run...
